          This FlashCards Web App was developed inspired by <a href="https://www.goconqr.com/flashcard/3144847/idiomatic-expressions-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a><span>‚¨Ä</span>. As I'm a software developer, and I'm learning English, I thought I could develop a similar one, suitable for mobile devices and with a simpler user interface.

          It is quite simple to use. You click or touch the screen to see the meaning of the <strong>idiom</strong> being presented. Such <strong>idiom</strong> will appear less often if you know what it means, and it will be shown more frequently if you don't.

          That's it. Check this box
          <input type="checkbox" onChange={onCheck} />
          if you don't want to see this introduction again.
